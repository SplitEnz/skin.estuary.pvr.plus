### Home Widgets

Widgets are horizontally layed out. The first element in this horizontal list is the widget header, after that the elements of the widget are displayed. The label of the header is customizable, clicking on the header does a "best fit" action depending on the type of widget. If a widget contains "playable" elements like  movies or songs, the element is played, for "non playable" elements an info window is shown.  
Because widgets are very individual per user, after Skin installation only some common widgets are activated (Live TV, TV Recordings, in progress movies, new movies, next episodes, new episodes). These are the widgets possible to activate:

- **Live TV Widgets**
    - **Live TV Channel List**: ordered by "last seen" or "channel number", with channel logo or epg image in poster or landscape format
    - **TV Recordings**: with channel logo or epg image in poster or landscape format
    - **German Telecast Offers**: addon to display "recommendations of the day" for german broadcasts
    - **broadcasts starting add...**: broadcasts of dedicated channels starting around a dedicated time (prime time for instance). Both the time and the channels to be displayed are configurable. After creating a "starting at" widget no channels are preselected. This has to be done afterwards.
    - **TV Timers**: square with channel logo
