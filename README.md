# Skin.Estuary.PVR.plus

EstuaryPVR+ is a modification of the default Estuary skin, originally written by Phil65 and now maintained by Team Kodi.
The skin aims to offer users some additional PVR features that are not currently available on the default version of Estuary and to have a more detailed OSD, whilst remaining a very light weight and easy-to-use skin.
 
### Dependencies

Estuary.PVR+ does not require any additional dependencies to work. However, some addiotnal PVR features will only work when the Skin.Helper.Script is installed. This addon can be downloaded from here [https://github.com/kodi-community-addons/script.skin.helper.service]
